	Block Scope<br>
	Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.<br>

	ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.<br>

	These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.<br>

	Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block<br><br>

	Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.<br>

	Variables declared with the var keyword inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.
</p>

<h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using var</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
	var  x = 10;
	// Here x is 10

	{  
	var x = 2;
	// Here x is 2
	}

	// Here x is 2
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>


<h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using let</h2>

<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
	let  a = 10;
	// Here a is 10

	{  
	  let a = 2;
	  // Here a is 2
	}

	// Here a is 10
	document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = a;
</script>
